## Disclaimer

This Project is really barebones, not much but the finished module and code - which is still buggy.
This module is more a proof of concept than anything else. It can break if pushed and could potentially cause damage and harm. Use at your own risk!
Regarding the code: Readability, speed and size could be improved. But: finish fast :) may revisit this later but i'm not really in the mood for it now
